## Introduction
Economic growth and livelihood are closely tied to agriculture. One of the common challenges faced by Indian farmers is improper crop selection, leading to decreased productivity. This project aims to address these issues by providing a recommendation system that suggests suitable crops based on soil conditions.

## Features
- Predicts suitable crops based on input parameters.
- Web application for easy access.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pyprakhar/suitable_crop.git
   cd crop-recommendation
